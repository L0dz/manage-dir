# manage-dir
Created to manage hospital records, can manage people's data.

The program's language is italian, since it's my first language. This program was initially created for helping my father with his work, since he needs to manage many patients' data. There are many features: you can add an element, remove, edit, order by any element parameter, look for an element by any parameter, save, print or make multiple elmenets 'delivered'. It's a pretty simple concept, realized with python. It's a project that teached me a lot, I hope it's gonna be useful to someone
